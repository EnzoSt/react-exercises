State 02

When calling `setState` to increment the counter, should the parameter be a function or an object? Why?

It should be a Function because in general when we use an object parameter, we can not relay on the 
value being fresh when we have multiple calls to setStates, react batches thees type of calls and executes 
them as soon as possible to optimize performance.
So we can say: If the next value depends on the previous value of the state we should use a callback to call setState.
